        title: "Richard Buggy, mugger decoy",
        blurb: "In the early 1970's, a young officer named Richard Buggy held one of the stranger and more harrowing positions in the New York Police Department. Five days a week, working a 6 p.m.-to-2 a.m. shift for the department's anticrime unit, he got mugged for a living. The anticrime unit, based on Randalls Island, was a squad of 200 plainclothes officers created, in part, to stem the city's then-endemic mugging problem, and Mr. Buggy was its star decoy. Transforming himself into a cast of assailable characters, including an old woman, a tourist, a blind man and - his showstopper - a well-lubricated drunk, he wandered the city's avenues like a wounded gazelle roaming the high plains, enticing muggers to pounce. And pounce they did. Bands of muggers worked Times Square. Renegade muggers prowled the parks and the subways. With vast swaths of the city deemed unsafe, New Yorkers hemmed themselves in. The muggers, many of them drug-sick and desperate for cash, responded by going to their victims, attacking them in elevators, hallways and darkened apartment lobbies. Even children carried &ldquo;mugger's money,'' and sharing mugging stories became fodder for dinner party conversation. Because mugging is not recorded as a separate crime (it falls under the broader umbrella of robbery), it is hard to pin down exactly how many muggings were committed in a given year. In 1968, however, to cite one example, the police in Manhattan alone received 16,200 reports of muggings, and many more were likely committed but never reported. Women and the elderly were particular targets, but muggers were never ones to discriminate. In 1974, even John F. Kennedy Jr. was mugged in Central Park, which by then had become an overgrown no man's land.",

In centuries past, a degree of plumpness has been seen as indicative of personal or family prosperity: &ldquo;Calories were scarce, physical labor was hard, and most people were as lean as greyhounds.&rdquo; In particular, a married woman who was thin was pitied, as her shape showed that her husband could not afford to feed her properly; conversely, having a fat wife was a status symbol: there was plenty to eat, and she did not need to work hard. Only in the early 20th Century did fatness lose this appeal. The connection of fatness with financial well-being persists today in some less-developed countries.

By 1961, 40% of Americans were buying and consuming diet products. By 1979, Weight Watchers was pulling in almost $40 million in yearly profits. By 1990, dieting was a $33 million dollar business. Overweight people were shamed in the media, often presented as unpatriotic or immoral in their profligacy. In the 21st century, it has become virtually impossible to sort out all the fad diets and exercise programs. Americans have chased after the Rice Diet, the Atkins Plan, low-carb, low fat, have ranged from the Mediterranean to Sonoma to Beverly Hills in their quest for the perfect program. They’ve quaffed gallons of cabbage soup and Slim-Fast, and even valiantly (and briefly) attempted to “eat like the French,” whatever that meant. Realistically, each individual has to eat the same amount of calories as he expends in order to reach or remain at his ideal weight; he should also engage in some type of enjoyable physical activity. Barring a medical condition, such a program will result in success. However, if history is any guide, Americans find sensible weight loss and maintenance methods too boring and slow. Thus the U.S. will continue to fall for the latest fad with great enthusiasm, while carefully keeping an eye peeled for the next overrated nostrum on the horizon.

        blurb: "Larry Fay (1888 – January 1, 1933) was one of the early rumrunners of the Prohibition Era in New York City. He made a half a million dollars bringing whiskey into New York from Canada. Fay took his bootlegging profits and put them into his taxi cab company. His cabs were designed to be as flashy as he was. They had lots of nickel trimming, lights on both the top and sides, and musical horns. Fay’s drivers took many inebriated customers to &ldquo;clip joints&rdquo; that sprang up when prohibition started. Clip joints were elaborately concealed speakeasies where the drunken patrons were rendered unconscious by more liquor, or if necessary, drugs. They were then relieved of their money and driven a short distance from the area and deposited in the gutter. He later opened a nightclub, the El Fey, on West 47th Street in Manhattan in 1924, featuring Texas Guinan as the emcee and a floorshow produced by Nils Granlund. Fay, who had a record of forty-nine arrests but no felony convictions, was involved in several enterprises in the ensuing years, and was said to have amassed and lost a fortune. He was made a partner of the Casa Blanca Club, where he was shot four times after a 1932 New Year's Eve celebration by the club's doorman who had just learned his pay was being reduced by Fay to accommodate a new employee. He died the next day. On December 15, 1960, The Untouchables (1959 TV series) during its second season did The Larry Fay Story. This episode (the 37th for the series) dealt with Larry Fay's activities in the New York City milk price-fixing case. Also, Fay's life served as the basis for James Cagney's character, Eddie Bartlett, in the 1939 gangster film, The Roaring Twenties.",

        title: "The National Debt clock",
        blurb: "The National Debt Clock is a billboard-sized running total dot-matrix display which constantly updates to show the current United States gross national debt and each American family's share of the debt. The idea for the clock came from New York real estate developer Seymour Durst, who wanted to highlight the rising national debt. In 1989, he sponsored the installation of the first clock - It was mounted a block from Times Square, on a Durst building at Sixth Avenue near 42nd Street, facing the north side of 42nd Street and Bryant Park across the intersection. At the time, the national debt remained under $3 trillion but was rising. The clock was temporarily switched off from 2000 to 2002 due to the debt actually falling during that period. In 2004, the original clock was dismantled and replaced by the current clock at the new location one block away. In 2008, the U.S. national debt exceeded $10 trillion for the first time, leading to press reports that the clock had run out of digits. According to Douglas Durst, his father had been toying with the basic idea of drawing attention to the growing national debt since at least 1980, when during the holiday season he sent cards that said &ldquo;Happy New Year. Your share of the national debt is $35,000&rdquo; to senators and congressmen. In the early eighties, when Durst first developed the idea of a constantly updated clock, the technology required to implement the project was not yet available.",

The name stuck, even after The New York Times moved across Broadway in 1913, and it is now known worldwide as a symbol of the American spirit. Longacre Square started with a few brownstones built by a developer who saw potential for a new &ldquo;uptown&rdquo; neighborhood. Following the area's development, people moved to the square in droves, and with them came brothels, pickpockets, and streetwalkers. Soon, in a foreshadowing of its later fate, the area turned into a veritable red-light district. In 1895, Longacre Square had a new tenant, Oscar Hammerstein I, who developed a large entertainment complex in the hopes of rekindling an interest in opera. This complex, called the Olympia, occupied a full block on 42nd Street and featured three theaters. During this time, many new theaters opened on the Great White Way, so named for Broadway's famous light show. The vaudeville circuit found success along with legitimate theater.",

Nevertheless, the crowds still gathered in Times Square in those years and greeted the New Year with a minute of silence followed by the ringing of chimes from sound trucks parked at the base of the tower - a harkening-back to the earlier celebrations at Trinity Church, where crowds would gather to &ldquo;ring out the old, ring in the new.&rdquo; The actual notion of a ball &ldquo;dropping&rdquo; to signal the passage of time dates back long before New Year's Eve was ever celebrated in Times Square. The first &ldquo;time-ball&rdquo; was installed atop England's Royal Observatory at Greenwich in 1833.

        blurb: "In the midst of Times Square, the bustling, light filled, people-packed, center of New York City, there is a secret. As many as one thousand people in an hour cross the pedestrian island that runs between 45th and 46th Street where Broadway and 7th Avenue intersect, not noticing that there is anything that differentiates this island from all the others in Manhattan. However those people with particularly open ears, or those who happen to be walking slightly below the average New York pace, may notice a mysterious humming noise, rather like the clanking of a distant machine. Although no plaque can be found, no explanatory text to accompany this unique experience, it is, in fact, a work of art, entitled Times Square, and its artist is Max Neuhaus. The work was originally installed at the same site from 1977-1992, at which point Neuhaus dismantled it because he had to return to Europe and the piece required constant monitoring. However, Times Square was missed, and during 2001 and 2002, the Times Square Street Business Improvement District (BID), Christine Burgin, the MTA Arts for Transit, and the Dia Art Foundation collaborated to reinstate Neuhaus's project. The block of sound returned to 46th Street on 22 May 2002, where it has remained for the public to experience twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. While standing inside Neuhaus's project, the sound seems most intense at the level right above your head, enhancing the illusion that the noises have no agent. Neuhaus says the sound must be made to be &ldquo;almost plausible,&rdquo; so that when people can't find any immediate cause, they think it comes from the subway. In reality, they are correct that the sound originates in the subway chamber below. The North side of the pedestrian island, at 46th Street, is covered by a large subway grating which spans an area of the Times Square 42nd Street station where several subway tunnels intersect. The block of sound that seems to hover above the island is created from resonances that are already present below the ground due to this unusual tunnel junction. Neuhaus listened closely to these sounds, and he built a machine that would amplify and enhance the resonances so they could be heard above ground. He then spent months creating the block of sound that we now experience. Neuhaus did this without the aid of computer or electronic music, and the block of sound is built entirely from already existing resonances. For this reason, Neuhaus speaks of &ldquo;building&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;composing&rdquo; his sound.",

In November of that year, homelessness was presented as a social problem in the Times. Times Square was reported to have a problem with &ldquo;sleepy winos&rdquo; and &ldquo;aggressive street corner drinkers.&rdquo; This was because, the paper reported, these street dwellers had judged the Times Square area to be safer than the Bowery, where a rash of &ldquo;muggers, drug addicts, the conversion of flophouses to loft apartments, and the influx of mental patients&rdquo; had made the area unlivable (NYT, November 14, 1978). - From the book Seasons such as these: how homelessness took shape in America by Cynthia J.

As the DEIS went on  to explain: There are, after all, no laws in our society which foreclose standing on public sidewalks to watch those passing by, but on the contrary, the ability to assemble freely is constitutionally protected. The police cannot arrest people simply because they are standing around - and this is a good deal of what takes place on 42nd Street. Yet it is also in [this] context ... that the illegal activities function and are able to function.

Created in 1935, it is one of the oldest college football awards, has been presented a total of 75 times in its history so far, and is considered to be one of the highest individual college football honors.<br /><br />Prior to the September 11th attacks in 2001, the Heisman Trophy Awards ceremony had taken place at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. However, after the southern Manhattan facility was damaged in the terrorist attacks, the New York Marriott Marquis in Times Square became the venue for that year. The following year, in 2002, the Downtown Athletic Club declared bankruptcy, so Yale Club became the venue that year and the next. In 2004, it took place at the Hilton New York. Since 2005, the award has been presented at the Nokia Theatre Times Square. That year, the Downtown Athletic Club and Heisman Trust were also able to resume full control of their Heisman Trophy awards ceremony.",

In 1989 the church moved to the former Mark Hellinger Theatre, its current location on 51st Street. The church is headquartered in a theater building originally built by Warner Bros. in 1930 as a movie palace, the Warner Hollywood Theatre, which was later converted to a Broadway venue, the Mark Hellinger Theatre.

After cleaning up what had become the most corrupt police department of any city in America, La Guardia set about to destroy the gambling sites and dens of sexual and alcoholic corruption that had flourished during the previous administration. The legendary La Guardia crackdown on 42nd Street was intended to make an example of those whose moral breakdown had helped to depress the city economically. One by one he personally padlocked the street's notorious burlesque houses, strip joints, game parlors, and houses of prostitution, among them the China Doll, Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe, the Latin Quarter, the Versailles, and the Paradise. Such was La Guardia's at times juvenile manner that often, when speeding down the street holding on to the side of a racing fire engine, he'd stick his tongue out at whatever club owners happened to be standing outside, or raise his thumb to his nose and wiggle his fingers. He also removed 42nd Street's traditional trolley cars, because, he angrily declared, they were too provocative, allowing women's dresses to blow above their knees, and besides they slowed down his beloved fire trucks.",

He needed the money and headed with three friends to Quad Studios in Times Square. After Shakur and his entourage entered the building's lobby, they were attacked from behind. Shakur was shot five times and robbed. After the attackers fled, Shakur and his friends struggled into the elevator and ascended to the ninth floor. A bloodied Shakur staggered into Quad Studios and was surprised to find rival rappers Combs and B.I.G. there. Shakur was convinced that he had been the target of a hit, not a robbery. Shakur's lawyer, Michael Warren, told The Consortium that Shakur believed that the conspiracy also might have involved police officers who considered him a black troublemaker. Shakur's suspicions deepened when he discovered that a police detective, Craig McKernan, who had testified against him in the sex-crime case, was at the scene of the shooting. Shakur claimed that McKernan taunted him about the bullet wounds to the groin. ",

The real-life model for The Great Gatsby's Meyer Wolfsheim and Nathan Detroit from Guys and Dolls, Rothstein was much more—and less—than a fixer of baseball games. Arnold Rothstein was a loan shark, pool shark, bookmaker, thief,fence of stolen property, political fixer, Wall Street swindler, labor racketeer, rumrunner, and mastermind of the modern drug trade. He was murdered in November 1928 murder in a Times Square hotel room. The shooting was allegedly linked to a gambling event that Rothstein had participated in the previous month with several associates and acquaintances. According to underworld folklore, it was a spectacular three-day, high-stakes poker game held somewhere in Manhattan. Rothstein apparently experienced a cold streak with the cards and ended up owing $320,000 at the end of the game. However, Rothstein refused to pay the debt, claiming the game was fixed. The hit was arranged to punish Rothstein for reneging on this debt. Gambler George &ldquo;Hump&rdquo; McManus was arrested for the murder, but later acquitted for lack of evidence. Rothstein's violent death eventually helped bring down Tammany Hall, the nation's biggest political machine—and helped make Fiorello LaGuardia mayor and Franklin Roosevelt president.",

On December 2, 1985, Aniello \"Neil\" Dellacroce died of lung cancer. Castellano then made two major mistakes. First, he did not attend Dellacroce's funeral - which was viewed as highly disrespectful by the Dellacroce/Gotti loyalists. Second, Castellano then named his bodyguard, Tommy Bilotti, as the new underboss. Although Bilotti was a loyal mobster, he was also a brutish loanshark with little of the diplomatic skill required to hold such a high rank within the organization. The final nail in his coffin was put in place when he announced to the family that he was breaking up Gotti's crew and reassigning them.
